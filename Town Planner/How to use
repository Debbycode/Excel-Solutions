The Excel solution helps town planners, especially the desk officer, record forms sold to professional association members. 
The solution takes into account the date and time the form was given out and the amount paid. It also keeps a record of forms allocated to each professional 
member and the forms remaining to be collected. A quarterly sales record is calculated for each member.

Step 1:
In the "List Data" sheet, input all the names of the members. The names in the column are for Demo. You should delete and replace with your names
These changes will be reflected in the "Marketing Data Plan" sheet 

Sheet 2:
Choose the date the transaction was made, including the number of forms issued, the amount paid and the date the amount was paid. Changes will be made automatically
